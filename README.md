## Problem 1 (8.2) Cost of Labor

Why is the number of operators per shift multiplied by approximately 4.5 to obtain the total number of operators to run the plant?

In a plant, we assume that an operator would work 5 days a week and have 3 weeks off a week. This means that he works 49 weeks a year. The calculations below show how we were able to determine the 4.5 operators/year.

## Problem 2 (8.5) Cost of Cooling Water

Cooling water is priced on an energy basis: $/GJ. The temperature rise is usually assumed to be 10C. Does the cooling water cost change if the return temperature changes? Are there any limitations to the return temperature? Explain.

## Problem 3 (8.10) Cost of Steam

When a chemical plant needs steam at multiple pressure levels, it is often economical to generate all the steam at a high pressure and then let the steam down through pressure-reducing turbines to the desired pressure. This principle is illustrated in Figure 8.6. The downside of this approach is that as the exhaust pressure of the turbine increases, the theoretical (and actual) steam requirements increase, meaning that less energy is extracted. To illustrate this point, do the following:

a. Estimate the amount of energy extracted from 10,000 kg/h of 58.6 barg steam superheated by 165C when connected to the following turbines (each 80% efficient):
  i. Exhaust pressure is 4'' Hg absolute
  ii. Exhaust pressure is 4.82 barg
b. Estimate the amount of energy extracted from 10,000 kg/h of saturated, 10.0 barg steam when connected to a turbine (80% efficient) exhausting at 4.82 barg.
c. Identify the locations of each of these three turbines described above on Figure 8.6

## Problem 4 (8.12) Cost of Refrigeration

Determine the cost of producing a refrigerant stream at -50C using propane as the working fluid in a non-cascaded system. You may wish to refer to Example 8.5 to do this problem. The steps you should follow are as follows:

a. Determine the pressure at which propane can be condensed at 45C, which assumes that cooling water with a 5C temperature approach will be used as the condensing medium.
b. Determine the pressure to which the propane must be throttled in order to liquefy it at -50C.
c. Use the results of Parts (a) and (b) to set the approximate pressure levels in the condenser and evaporator in the refrigeration system.
d. Determine the amount of propane necessary to extract 1 GJ of heat in the evaporator.
e. Assuming a 5 kPa pressure drop in both heat exchangers and that a single-stage compressor is used with an efficiency of 75%, determine the cost of electricity to run the compressor, determine the cooling water cost, and from this determine the cost of providing refrigeration at -50C using propane as the working fluid.

## Problem 5 (8.18) Cost of Manufacturing for a Plant

Estimate the cost of operating labor (C_OL), the cost of utilities (C_UT), and the cost of manufacturing (COM_d) for the ethylene oxide process given in Project B.6 of Appendix B. You must do Problem 7.26 in order to estimate COM_d *(done in HW2)*.

Also report the COM_d in units of $/kg product and compare to the selling price of ethylene oxide.
